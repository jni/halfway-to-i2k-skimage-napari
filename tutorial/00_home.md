# Image analysis and visualization in Python with scikit-image, napari, and friends

This tutorial is aimed at folks who have some experience in scientific computing with
Python, but are new to image analysis.
To get the most out of it, they should have done some work with NumPy arrays — no need
to be an expert! — but they don't need to know an image from a pipe.
We will cover the fundamentals of working with images in scientific Python.
The tutorial will be split into four parts, of about 45 minutes each, plus breaks:

## Instructors
The instructors for this workshop are
- Juan Nunez-Iglesias
- Kira Evans
- Lars Grüter

## Goals
The aim of this tutorial is to provide an introduction to bioimage analysis with Python,
scikit-image and `napari`.
By the end of the tutorial attendees will leave understanding how to work with images in
Python, knowing some of the main libraries that can help them do that, and knowing where
to get more help if they need it.
